Snarf appointment data from a selection of a user's Google calendars 

## What is here

I've provided code for the authorization (oauth2) protocol for Google
calendars.  There is also a picker for a date range. 

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

Code runs on local and should run on ix. You will need your own verification secret key to access google.
Change the port number in the CONFIG file to match your credentials when you made your key.

## Steps to run

1:choose date
2:verify
3:choose calendars
4:auto updates with busy times
